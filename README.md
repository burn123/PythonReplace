# PythonReplace
PythonReplace is a simple script that takes any input file, and replaces its' contents based on patterns from another input file.
This is useful for files where you find yourself doing the same "Find and Replace" operations on often.

## Requirements
All you need is Python 3 (this was created using 3.6.4, use that if any problems arise with earlier versions).
